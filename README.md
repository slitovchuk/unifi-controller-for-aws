# Unifi Controller for AWS

[uni-stack.yml](../blob/master/uni-stack.yml) is an Amazon AWS Cloudformation stack template which deploys a [unifi-docker](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker) container to an EC2 instance.


[uni-stack.yml](../blob/master/uni-stack.yml) template can be deployed with the use of AWS Cloudformation UI or with AWS CLI that requires to specify all the stack parameters which don't have a default value.


Some AWS Cloudformation CLI commands useful for the stack deployment and management can be found in [aws-utils.sh](../blob/master/scripts/aws-utils.sh).
